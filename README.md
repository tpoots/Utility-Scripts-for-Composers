# Utility-Scripts-for-Composers
A collection of useful scripts for composers. Mainly related to the creation of an OpenStageControl template that can control your articulation selections with Cubase 11.

These repository should be considered `DEPRECATED` for now as I have not updated it to take advantage of Cubase 12+ MIDI Remote Scripts. MIDI Remote Scripts eliminates the need to do SyxEx track name parsing the "complicated way". With it you can send the full track name. There's a rather long thread about how to set all this up here which should get you started: https://vi-control.net/community/threads/open-stage-control-tutorial-an-alternative-to-lemur-and-touchosc.72643/

There is also no longer any need to do parsing of expression maps in order to generate static config for Open Stage Control, as the OSC Module can parse the expression maps itself. These scripts have been deleted in the latest commit.
